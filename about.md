Hello! This blog is a toy project by the SigMaSense team. If you're interested in doing research with us, check out our open topics [over here](https://3ddp.github.io/sigmasense-topics/) and/or drop us an email at **WIP**. 

This blog uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The comments are handled via Github issues as explained [here](https://dc25.github.io/myBlog/2017/06/24/using-github-comments-in-a-jekyll-blog.html) and [here](https://github.com/dc25/minimaWithGithubComments).
